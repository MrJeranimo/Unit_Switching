# TempDebug

This is just a temporary KSA debug panel made by MrJeranimo. The original code was provided by BarneyTheGod.

The Source code is more useful than the debug as it shows you how to access Classes and Properties like all the Celestials in the system and their ID (name).

Known Bugs: If you close the window, there is no way to get it back besides restarting the game.

## Installation

If you install the Release, just make sure to add

```
[[mods]]
id = "TempDebug"
enabled = true
```

to `\Kitten Space Agency\Content\mainfest.toml` or `\Documents\My Games\Kitten Space Agency\manifest.toml`.

And mak sure you put the `TempDebug` folder in `\Kitten Space Agency\Content\`.

If you are a modder and you want to use any of the code, go ahead.
